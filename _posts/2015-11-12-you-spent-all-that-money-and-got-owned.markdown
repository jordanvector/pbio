This video is about one of our favorite lecturers from DEFCON, Joseph McCray.  McCray is very experienced in the CompSec world and does a very good job of explaining very difficult concepts in an easy to understand way.

He swears quite often, so if you are offended by that then this video is not for you.  For everyone else, this guys is awesome and he doesnâ€™t sound like the typical computer nerd that is trying to confuse you with his intelligence.  Enjoy.
